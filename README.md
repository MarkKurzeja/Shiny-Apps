# Shiny Applications

This is the development page for the shiny applications that I am currently 
developing. There are a variety of apps that aim to demonstrate a variety of 
statistics concepts for different applications. Kindly let me know if you find 
this page and have any suggestions. I am relatively new to Shiny, and so 
programatically there is some updates that could certainly be made.
